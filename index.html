      <p>Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska. His father Earl Little was an itinerant baptist minister and a vehement advocate of <a href="#" id="Garvey">Marcus Garvey</a>. The local Ku Klux Klan in Omaha frequently harassed Malcolm's family because of his father's preaching that was "stirring up the good ole black folks" in their estimation. Consequently, the Little family moved to Lansing, Michigan this is where Malcolm grew up. Although the Little family relocated to Michigan, Earl Little's sermons that were disseminated to local African-American churches did not cease. The contents in these sermons integrated Marcus Garvey's Pan-African/racial pride ideologies and rhetoric. Inevitably, the Little family was again subjected to harassment this time by the local white supremacist group called the Black Legionaries. In 1931, Malcolm's father was brutally murdered by the Black Legionaries. Authorities asserted that his death was an accident. The widowed Mrs.Little was denied the benefits that were included in Earl Little's insurance policy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Following the untimely death of her husband, Louise Little tried desperately to provide for her seven children but that effort would ultimately take a significant toll on her. Louise worked a variety of menial jobs, however when it was revealed who she widowed she would be terminated almost immediately. From a financial standpoint, the Little family at this point was impoverished, eventually, they came to rely upon state welfare. Moreover, state agency officers around this time period would frequently visit the Little household, constantly asserting Louise's incompetence in regard to taking care of her children. Inevitably, Louise suffered a complete mental breakdown and was committed to Kalamazoo State Hospital. Malcolm along with his siblings became wards of the state. Subsequently, they were separated and sent to foster homes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Malcolm attended West Junior High School in Lansing and then Mason High School in Mason, Michigan, but left high school in 1941, before graduating. While in junior high school Malcolm excelled in his academics, however, what compelled him to drop out of school was a statement a white teacher made whenever Malcolm relayed to him his aspirations to become a lawyer. Stating that Malcolm's aspirations were "no realistic goal for a nigger". Consequently, Malcolm began to isolate himself from white people and longed to be amongst his own kind. This sentiment compelled him to reach out to his half-sister <a href="#" id="Ella">Ella Little-Collins</a>. Ella lived in Roxbury, a largely African-American neighborhood of Boston and Malcolm longed to move in and live with her.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While in Boston, Malcolm held a variety of jobs initially working as a shoeshine boy at the <a href="#" id="Roseland">Roseland State Ballroom</a>. The Roseland State Ballroom which was in downtown Boston hosted a myriad of popular musical acts that performed this had a profound effect on Malcolm who was enamored by the performances. After incessant coaxing by Ella, Malcolm worked at a Townsend drugstore that was closer to home (Roxbury). The conversations amongst the African-American Bostonians revolved around the alluring glamour of New York's Harlem. Fascinated and enticed, Malcolm eventually moved to New York City's Harlem neighborhood in 1943, where he found employment on the New Haven Railroad while simultaneously engaging in illicit hustles such as drug dealing, gambling, racketeering, robbery, and pimping.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In late 1945, Malcolm returned to Boston perpetuating his illicit hustles with a crime syndicate of four other accomplices participating in burglaries aimed at wealthy white homes. In 1946, he was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left at a shop for repairs, and in February began serving an eight-to-ten-year sentence at <a href="#" id="Charlestown">Charlestown State Prison</a> for larceny and breaking and entering. Two years later, Malcolm was transferred to <a href="#" id="Norfolk">Norfolk Prison Colony</a>.</p>

      <p>Malcolm had become accustomed to the unscrupulous underworld of the hustler, which consisted of various forms of immorality. In his current predicament being incarcerated, Malcolm was in an unfamiliar environment. No longer able to partake in any of his illicit hustles Malcolm was relegated to an idle state. However, there was one prisoner in particular who fascinated Malcolm. <a href="#" id="Bimbi">John Bembry "Bimbi"</a> was a fellow convict, who through sheer effort and commitment had reformed himself into a literate and articulate individual. Malcolms interactions and conversations with Bimbi had a profound effect on him. Malcolm would later describe him as: "the first man I had ever seen command total respect ... with words". This was the catalyst that set Malcolm on a road of radical reformation and transformation. Under Bimbi's tutelage and influence Malcolm gained an insatiable desire for reading and learning. Furthermore, to expound on his new desire to learn Malcolm started to take advantage of the prisons correspondence courses and the library. As a result of his previous life as a hustler Malcolm had abandoned his scholarly ways, however his studies in prison proved useful because after some time he began to regain proper grammar etiquette and his vocabulary began to expand. Addtionally, Malcolm participated in the prison debates and developed a passion for it. Thoroghly researching points that would espouse his sides argument and also ruminating about the opposing sides retorts. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Malcolm's sibilings would occasionally send him letters which consisted of their new found advocacy for a relatively new movement they had joined. The Nation of Islam (NOI), whose primary message was one of Black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the African diaspora to Africa, where they would be free from white American and European domination. Initially, Malcolm was vaguely intrigued however a letter from his younger brother Reginald that was sent in 1948 would change that sentiment. The letter simply read: "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison." Subsquently, Malcolm stopped smoking and eating pork presuming that his younger brother had some sort of hype that would vindicate him out of prison.</p>
      <br>
      <p> During his visit Reginald elucidated the message that he had sent to Malcolm via letter, he (Reginald) went on to describe the NOI teachings, which included the belief that all white people were inherently evil and were "devils." After retrospectively looking back on his own life, Malcolm deduced that this belief was valid. Furthermore, Malcolm concluded that all the relationships he previously had with white people had been marred with dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Because of his hostility towards religion Malcolm had earned the alias "Satan" while in prison, however he became receptive to the NOI teachings. In late 1948, Malcolm sent a handwritten letter to Elijah Muhammad the leader of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad replied exhorting him to renounce the actions of his previous life and humbly ask for forgiveness of his immoral ways and to vow never to behave in that destructive behavior again. Though he later recalled the inner struggle he had bending his knees to pray, Malcolm soon became a member of the Nation of Islam, maintaining regular communication with Muhammad. It is at this point that Malcolm began siging his name as "Malcolm X". Muhammad instructed his followers to leave their family names behind when they joined the NOI and use "X" instead. When the time was right, after they had proven their sincerity, he said, he would reveal the Muslim's "original name". </p>
      <h1>Early Ministry</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>In spring of 1952, Malcolm was granted parole subsequently moving in with his oldest brother Wilfred and his family in Detroit. It is here where Malcolm began to attend the regular meetings of the Nation's <a href="#" id="one">Detroit Temple Number One</a>, which was established in 1931 by Mr. Wallace D. Fard. This setting was conducive to the expansion and broadening of Malcolms knowledge in NOI ideologies and philosophy. Malcolm was astounded by the way NOI members conducted themselves. Members meticulously adhered to the spiritual and moral standard established by the NOI. Additionally, the warm and genuine environment that was common place at NOI meetings had a profound effect on Malcolm stating: "I had never dreamed of anything like that atmosphere among black people who had learned to be proud they were black, who had learned to love other black people instead of being jealous and suspicious" .</p>
      <br>
      <p>On August 31, 1952 in a motor caravan of other Detroit Temple Number One Muslims, Malcolm would finally get a chance to meet Elijah Muhammad. Detroit Temple Number One along with the other temples nationwide made their way to <a href="#" id="two">Chicago's Temple Number Two</a> to hear Elijah Muhammad speak at a Muslim rally. Following this rally Malcolm's resolve to dedicate himself to growth and success of the NOI was affirmed. Conversely, Malcolm was baffled at the low attendance numbers at the regular weekly NOI meetings believing that each meeting should have been filled to capacity. This belief along with advice from Elijah Muhammad is what compelled Malcolm along with some other NOI members to go on a rampant "fishing" campaign, which was essentially "fishing" or looking for potential NOI members in the streets of Detroit.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In his previous life Malcolm was immersed into the street life; furthermore, he was fully cognizant of street code and lingo. This reality abetted him in winning converts and membership in Detroit's Temple Number One steadily increased. In June 1953 (During this year the FBI began surveillance of Malcolm, turning it's attention his possible communist associations to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.), Malcolm was named assistant minister of the Nation's Temple Number One in Detroit. Later that year he established Boston's Temple Number 11; in March 1954, he expanded Temple Number 12 in Philadelphia; and two months later he was selected to lead Temple Number 7 in Harlem, where he rapidly expanded its membership. In 1955, Malcolm perpetuated his successful recruitment on behalf of the Nation; additionally, establishing temples  Springfield, Massachusetts (Number 13); Hartford, Connecticut (Number 14); and Atlanta (Number 15). Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month.</p>
      <h1>Marriage and Family</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>In 1955, <a href="#" id="Betty">Betty Sanders</a> met Malcolm X following one of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was regularly attending his lectures. In 1956, she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to Betty X. One on one dates were taboo within the Nation's teachings; consequently, the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm X made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Malcolm X proposed to Betty during a telephone call from Detroit in January 1958, and they married two days later. They went on to have six daugthers:  <a href="#" id="Attallah">Attallah</a> (b. 1958; Arabic for "gift of God"; perhaps named after Attila the Hun); Qubilah (b. 1960, named after Kublai Khan);  <a href="#" id="Ily">Ilyasah</a> (b. 1962, named after Elijah Muhammad); Gamilah Lumumba (b. 1964, named after Gamal Abdel Nasser and Patrice Lumumba); and twins Malikah (1965–2021) and Malaak (b. 1965 after their father's death, and named in his honor). </p>
